# decision_roulette

Simple roulette app / game / utility.

Are you bad at making decisions? You would flip a coin, but your memory is very short to remember what was "head" or "tails" after the coin dropped? Or you just simply can't find a 10-sided coin? Then this is for you!

Write a list of options, separated by comma, of every possible choice you want to appear on the roulette. Click OK, then click SPIN! and let the Decision Roulette decide for yourself.
